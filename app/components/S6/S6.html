                    <h1>Expectations, Beliefs<em>, And Immunity </em></h1>
                </div>
               <p>Finally, let’s consider how beliefs can influence your immune system and health. Naturally, I’m referring to the placebo effect, which serves as the most convincing line of evidence that there is a link between the mind and the body. It is triggered by beliefs and expectations. The drug companies use it all the time. It’s the reason different colors, tastes, and textures are used when marketing a particular drug. No, we should not ignore the concept of placebo. Instead, we should make full use of it. Here’s an illustration of what I’m talking about.<br><br>
Imagine you have never heard of an herbal remedy recently introduced to the US market. Experts claim, “This product, if taken according to our instructions, will cure your arthritis, multiple-sclerosis, allergies, and keep you from catching colds and flu.” Elsewhere in the brochure are personal testimonials from patients and claims by doctors.<br><br>
How is this advertised claim likely to influence you? If you’re a skeptic, then your response might wisely be, “This is too good to be true.” (This is probably a correct assumption. Allergy and arthritis are examples of too much immunity. Colds and other infections are manifestations of too little. A single formulation couldn’t aid both types of conditions.)<br><br>On the other hand, the image created by these words may increase your expectations that the product will do the same for you. It might, but, be careful. You want to be sure that any benefits are due to the ingredients and not to just your belief. Be objective, and follow the protocol that I’ve described in the next chapter to make sure it’s really working. Even then, realize that there are probably other factors involved. There are as many possibilities for why improved health can occur as there are factors which can influence it. You’ll never know for sure whether what you take is really responsible for the outcome. Nor can you be sure that it wasn’t. That’s why you should remain open-minded and collect your own data.<br><br>
I overheard while taking a break from a lecture tour one of the most honest assessments of how remedies work from a homeopath in London. I’d stopped in to look around her shop. While there, an elderly lady came in, very agitated. She marched to the counter with her big, shopping bag, pulled out a half-empty vial of medicine, slammed it on the counter, and loudly declared, “This medicine has not helped my arthritis at all. In fact, I knew it wasn’t going to help when I bought it. I knew I was wasting my money. It may have made my arthritis even worse, so I would like my money back, please.” And the shopkeeper responded by saying, “Mrs. Jones, with that attitude, I’m not surprised the medicine didn’t work. It’s a homeopathic medicine. It can’t work by itself. You have to help it. Now, I want you to change your attitude. I want you to take what’s left of this medicine, think positively about it, believe in it, and if it still doesn’t work, then I will give you your money back. But, you change your attitude first, so it can do what it’s supposed to do.” And Mrs. Jones got very flustered. She said, “Yes, of course, you’re right. I’m sorry,” and off she went.<br><br>
How I wished I could have tape-recorded that exchange because that homeopath was being honest. She was acknowledging what everyone who dispenses any type of medicine should acknowledge. Nothing is working for a single reason. One of the most enduring pathways to optimal health is your belief. Use it to enhance the other things you might be doing.<br><br></p>
